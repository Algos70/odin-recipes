        The yummiest preparation mixture for ground beef EVER! I have made this
        Lebanese Meat for all of my friends and family and have HAD to leave the
        recipe with everyone! Meat mixture can be used for everything...
        meatballs, meatloaf, BBQ skewers, BBQ'd hamburgers. FOR BEST, AUTHENTIC
        LEBANESE TASTE, DO NOT OMIT OR SUBSTITUTE INGREDIENTS (until you have made
        it this way ;P )
    </p>

        <li>1½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, grated</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. </li>
        <li>If using wooden skewers, soak in water.</li>

            evenly blended. </li>
        <li>Divide into 6 portions, and press around one end of the skewers to form a log shape
            approximately 1 inch thick and 6 inches long.</li>
